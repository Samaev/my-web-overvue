        With a whopping 3+ years of full-time production in Web Development, I've become a coding maestro! VueJS and Laravel are practically my best buddies, and my HTML/CSS/Bootstrap skills are so sharp they can cut through code like a hot knife through butter – preprocessors don't stand a chance!

        So here's a concise summary of my 4+ yr comercial experience: 2 years of Software Information Security with Vanilla JS and Vue.js + 19 months of experience with Vue.js and Laravel with an American Healthcare product.

        But hey, I'm not just a coding wizard – I'm also a master coordinator! I've led Support Managers and QA Engineers with the finesse of a conductor leading an orchestra. Teamwork is my jam, and I know how to keep the harmony going.

        My love for the IT environment runs deep – it's been my home for a glorious 8 years. Working with native speakers at an American IT company has given me an "Upper Intermediate" level of English that allows me to chat tech like a pro.

        When it comes to challenges, I don't back down – I tackle them head-on with gusto! Complications? Pfft, they're no match for my problem-solving skills. My results are always top-notch, and I'm not afraid to show off my magic touch in creating the most awe-inspiring solutions.
